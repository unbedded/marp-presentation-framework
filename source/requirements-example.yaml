  # Ground Truth Requirements (from specification document)
  - id: PRD-FUNC-001
    title: "Primary Function"
    source: "Requirements Doc Section 2.1"
    priority: "P0-Critical"
    type: "Functional"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "System shall perform [specific function]"
      - "Performance shall meet [specific metric]"
      - "Interface shall support [specific protocol]"
    verification: "Functional test + performance measurement"
    clear_or_vague: "Clear"
    notes: "This is a well-defined requirement with measurable criteria"

  - id: PRD-PERF-001
    title: "Performance Target"
    source: "Requirements Doc Section 3.2"
    priority: "P1-High"
    type: "Performance"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Response time ≤ [X] milliseconds"
      - "Throughput ≥ [Y] operations/second"
      - "Accuracy within [Z]% of target"
    verification: "Performance benchmark suite"
    clear_or_vague: "Clear"
    notes: "Quantitative requirements with specific thresholds"

  # Assumption Requirements (derived from vague specifications)
  - id: PRD-COST-001-ASMP
    title: "Cost Target - Derived from 'low cost at volume'"
    parent: "PRD-COST-001"
    source: "Derived from Requirements Doc vague statement 'low cost'"
    priority: "P1-High"
    type: "Assumption"
    derivation_process: |
      1. Market analysis: Competitor products range from $X to $Y
      2. Target market: [Market segment] willing to pay $Z
      3. Industry standard markup: 3× (BOM to retail)
      4. Derived BOM target: $Z ÷ 3 = $[Target] ±$[Range]
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "BOM cost ≤ $[Target + Range]"
      - "Target BOM = $[Target] (optimal)"
      - "Minimum viable = $[Target - Range]"
    alternative_scenarios:
      - scenario: "Premium segment"
        impact: "BOM budget increases to $[Higher Target]"
      - scenario: "Budget segment"
        impact: "BOM budget reduces to $[Lower Target]"
    risk_level: "HIGH"
    customer_validation_needed: true
    verification: "BOM cost analysis + market validation"
    notes: "Need customer confirmation of price point before committing to architecture"

  # Standard Requirements (regulatory/compliance)
  - id: NFR-STD-001
    title: "North America Regulatory Compliance (UL + FCC)"
    source: "Industry standard for consumer electronics"
    priority: "P1-High"
    type: "Standard"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "FCC Part 15 Class B compliance (radiated emissions)"
      - "UL certification for electrical safety"
      - "Lead-free ROHS compliance"
    verification: "Third-party certification testing"
    clear_or_vague: "Clear"
    notes: "Standard requirements for US market - non-negotiable"
